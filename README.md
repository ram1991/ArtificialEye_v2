# ArtificialEye_v2

This project is currently in development under the MAGIX Lab at UCLA.

An artificial eye to be used as the perception system for an artificial neural-network controlled 3D human model. 
The eyeball uses a soft-body simulated lens covered in a NURBs surface to maintain continous normals for accurate ray refraction.
The eyeball and lense are rendered in realtime using a purpose-built rendering framework written with OpenGL.
